# Using [RichTextEditor](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.richtexteditor.RichTextEditor) in a Fiori Elements Object Page

> **Note**: Follow this [link](https://github.com/stockbal/fiori-samples/tree/main) to show all available scenarios

This sample project showcases the usage of the [RichTextEditor](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.richtexteditor.RichTextEditor) with different approaches

## 1. Using the building block in a custom section

Here the FPM [building block](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html#/buildingBlocks/rte/rteSection) for the RichTextEditor control is used in a custom section.

### Components

- [Fragment](./app/wikipagemanager/webapp/ext/fragment/EditorWithBuildingBlock.fragment.xml)

## 2. Using the `RichTextEditor` control in the fragment of a custom section

In this approach the `RichTextEditor` control is directly defined in the custom section fragment. In a separate handler file the toolbar buttons are configured via the `Ready` event.

### Components

- [Fragment](./app/wikipagemanager/webapp/ext/fragment/EditorUsingFragment.fragment.xml)
- [Handler](./app/wikipagemanager/webapp/ext/fragment/EditorUsingFragment.ts)

## 3. Instantiating the `RichTextEditor` control in an object page controller extension

The last approach instantiates the editor control in the `PageReady` event.

### Components

- [Fragment](./app/wikipagemanager/webapp/ext/fragment/EditorUsingControllerExtension.fragment.xml)
- [Object Page Extension](./app/wikipagemanager/webapp/ext/controller/ObjectPageExt.controller.ts)

## Comparison of the 3 approaches

| Approach             | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| -------------------- | ---------- |- |
|1. FPM                | - Read-only control is generated by framework<br/>- Lifecycle is managed by Fiori Elements|- Height or other properties cannot be set in the fragment<br/>- Customization of editor is more difficult<br/>- Added button groups in toolbar may not follow prioritization order<br/>- Custom buttons are not possible|
|2. Editor in fragment | - All UI elements are defined in the fragment<br/>- Lifecycle is managed by Fiori Elements<br/>- Height and other control properties can be easily set	| - Additional controller extension is required if editor needs to be accessed in other FE exits (e.g. beforeEdit)<br/>- Editor customization (e.g. button groups) is done in custom handler<br/>- custom buttons need to be set in the handler in single fashion (i.e. editor.addCustomButton(new Button(â€¦))) as definition in fragment seems to have no effect|
|3. Editor in Page Extension | - Complete control over when editor is created<br/>- Height and other control properties can be easily set<br/>- Easy access to editor instance in other exits of Fiori Elements (e.g. beforeSave) |	- Lifecycle is the responsibility of extension<br/>- UI definition split between fragment and JavaScript code<br/>- fragment needs to be accessed by generated Id, which could change in future FE implementations|

## Testing the application

Run the following steps in a terminal to setup the project and start the development server

- `npm i`
- `npm run watch`

Open the [app](http://localhost:4004/com.demo.wikipagemanager/index.html?sap-ui-xx-viewCache=false) in the browser
