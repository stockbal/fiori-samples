It uses the third-party component called TinyMCE. In addition to the native toolbar, you can also use a toolbar built with SAPUI5 controls.</p><br/><h3>Overview</h3><br/><p>With version 1.48 onward, aside from the native toolbar of the TinyMCE, the <code>RichTextEditor</code> can also use a toolbar built with SAPUI5 controls. Which toolbar is used is taken into consideration only while the control is being initialized and it will not be possible to change it during runtime, because of lifecycle incompatibilities between the SAPUI5 and the third-party library. The custom toolbar acts like a wrapper to the native toolbar and takes care of synchronizing the state of its internal controls with the current state of the selection in the editor (bold, italics, font styles etc.).</p><br/><h4>Restrictions</h4><br/><p><strong>Note: The <code>RichTextEditor</code> uses a third-party component and therefore some additional restrictions apply for its proper usage and support. For more information see the Preamble section in <a href=\"https://ui5.sap.com/topic/d4f3f1598373452bb73f2120930c133c\" target=\"_self\">sap.ui.richtexteditor</a>.</strong></p><br/><h3>Guidelines</h3><br/><p> </p><ul><li>The <code>RichTextEditor</code> should be used for desktop apps only. However, if it is essential for your use case, you can enable the mobile version of TinyMCE, whilst having in mind the restrictions. For more information see the <a href=\"https://ui5.sap.com/topic/d4f3f1598373452bb73f2120930c133c\" target=\"_self\">sap.ui.richtexteditor documentation</a>.</li><br/><li>In order to be usable, the control needs a minimum width 17.5 rem and height of 12.5 rem.</li><li>Do not instantiate the <code>RichTextEditor</code> from a hidden container.</li><li>Make sure you destroy the <code>RichTextEditor</code> instance instead of hiding it and create a new one when you show it again.</li></ul>
